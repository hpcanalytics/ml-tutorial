### Welcome to the SPIDAL Image Processing and Optimization Library

This site features documentation on the image processing and optimization routines available in SPIDAL. In addition to information about how to use the libraries themselves, we include background information about what these routines do, how they work, and when to use them, and show examples of their use on real problems.

You can use this documentation in several different ways:

*   You have a problem and need to choose an appropriate model or algorithm. See [Documentation by Problem Type](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1713543/pages/Problems?titleize=0 "Problems") or our [Exemplar Applications](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1713543/pages/exemplar-applications "Exemplar Applications").
*   You'd like to learn more about or use a particular model. See [Documentation by Models](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1713543/pages/Models?titleize=0 "Models").
*   You'd like to learn more about or use a particular algorithm. See [Documentation by Algorithms](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1713543/pages/Algorithms?titleize=0 "Algorithms").
*   You'd like to see how to apply SPIDAL algorithms to real problems. See [Exemplar Applications](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1713543/pages/Exemplar%20Applications?titleize=0 "Exemplar Applications").






## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hpcanalytics/ml-tutorial/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
