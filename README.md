% ### Welcome to the SPIDAL Image Processing and Optimization Library %

This site features documentation on the image processing and optimization routines available in SPIDAL. In addition to information about how to use the libraries themselves, we include background information about what these routines do, how they work, and when to use them, and show examples of their use on real problems.

### You can use this documentation in severalÂ different ways:


* If you have a problem to solve and need to choose a model or algorithm see [Documentation by Problem Type].

* If you'd like to learn more about a particular model, see [Documentation by Models].

* If you'd like to learn more about a particular algorithm, see [Documentation by Algorithms](applications.html).

* If you'd like to see how to apply SPIDAL algorithsm to real problems, see [Exemplar Applications].
